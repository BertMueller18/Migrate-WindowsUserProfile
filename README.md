# Migrate-WindowsUserProfile
Migrate Windows user profile to a new machine using Microsoft USMT with a PowerShell GUI.

This requires that the USMT binaries are already present on the machine or a network accessible location. The easiest way to acquire these is to install the Windows ADK, and browse to the folder that contains scanstate.exe and loadstate.exe, and make a copy. For convenience sake, I've made the binaries available in a zip file in this repo.
